Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called 
Blue and Green.

At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic. 
For this example, Blue is currently live and Green is idle.

cf push Blue -n demo-time
cf push Green -n demo-time-temp
cf map-route Green example.com -n demo-time
cf unmap-route Blue example.com -n demo-time
Cloud Foundry community members have written plugins to automate the blue-green deployment process. These include:

Autopilot: Autopilot is a Cloud Foundry Go plugin that provides a subcommand, zero-downtime-push, for hands-off, zero-downtime application deploys.
BlueGreenDeploy: cf-blue-green-deploy is a plugin, written in Go, for the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) that automates a few steps involved in zero-downt
